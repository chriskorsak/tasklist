## Description

This task list application is a project from [Modern Javascript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning) on Udemy. It notably uses javascript DOM manipulation and local browser storage to persist the data without needing a database.

Additionally, this application uses a CSS framework called [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) to create the user interface. This application is fully responsive to all screen sizes.
